Black-box Unit Testing (BBUT) focuses on testing the functionality of a System Under Test (SUT)'s individual components or units without using knowledge from their source code to ensure that they behave properly and satisfy their defined specification.

AutoBBUT can be used for semi-automated generation of BBUT test cases in the .Net C# language for the Visual Studio Team Test platform.

It can also be easily extended/adapted to other platforms (e.g, JUnit).
